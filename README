Works with  Visual studio 2008

Install Panda 3D (tested with a daily build Panda 3d 1.8.0) and modify the Config.prc file to use directx8 display.

You need to add directories corresponding to your installed Panda3D version. If you installed to C:\Panda3D-1.8.0, for example, then you would add the following directories by using the Tools -> Options... pull-down menu and then selecting Projects and Solutions and in that selecting VC++ Directories and continuing on to enter the following:

Executable Files 
        C:\Panda3D-1.8.0\bin

Include Files  
        C:\Panda3D-1.8.0\python\include
        C:\Panda3D-1.8.0\include

Library Files 
        C:\Panda3D-1.8.0\python\libs
        C:\Panda3D-1.8.0\lib

Works only in release.
